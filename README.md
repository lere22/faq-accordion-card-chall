### What I learned

What i learned from creating the project FAQ accordion card is how to use srcset while controling the image for desktop preview and mobile preview, also I'm still trying to understand how to use position in CSS the correct way, so this is a good challenge for me.

### Continued development

I want to continue this project to collaborate with my other projects in the future.
